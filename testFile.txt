yes
Sigh. Redoing
or you could just use sudo sudo fdisk -l
I did, I did. What am I looking for here?
or the overly complicated way: "for each in /dev/sd[a-z] ; do parted $each print ; done"
I did it already! What am I trying to glean from this information? I already know what kind of partition I tried to write, and that's what it shows.
so am I correct in assuming there is data on there that you want back?
Not at all
are you just trying to mount it?
Yes
what file system is it?
fat32 Standard stuff
what happens when you do: "sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sd<drive><partition> /mount/point"? changing the relevant parts of course
Uuuuuuh, mount point?
an empty folder
I can mount devices to random folders on my drive? Like a boat?
it can be anywhere, the automount stuff usually uses /media, for custom ones for testing I use /mnt
Trying
devices can be mounted anywhere, you can also do this in windows, though most people still seem to like the drive letter paradigm.
Ran it, nothing happened. Shall I check /media/, the mount point? Wuh.... There is nothing in media
if you know the device, can you read the partition table?  eg: "sudo parted /dev/sdb print"? also, create an empty subfolder, /media is where automount creates folders, so you don't actually want to use /media
Why would that help? Also, trying Told me nothing I did not already know
ok, so there is a partition and parted did not return any errors?
Nope Gparted thinks it's okay, too. I keep doing checks, but nothing
so lets create a directory, /mnt/test or /media/test
Kay Woah, what
sudo m ount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/test if you don't care about the data, we can always reformat it
I did that There is no data
sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1 (or whatever the device and partition are) "sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdXN" will put a new file system on the device, wiping all previous data "sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=446 count=1" will wipe out any boot loaders that may be installed on that device
Oh, okay. I will save those commands *that last command
by normal I assume you mean a regular flash drive?
Nah, man. I totally want a vampire flash drive I want to name it Edward and paint it white
I would write out a new partition table actually I would write zeros to the whole disk first, though if this is a flash drive that is not really useful
L3top: Trying Aw sweet, it worked
awesome
Your command did the trick! I'm saving that one. You would not believe how hard it is to get this thing back to normal after android, although android is really fun Thanks so much, man. And if you would please, tell L3top thanks too
all that command does is remove the boot loader that android (or any OS for that matter) from the drive.  It should leave the partition table alone glad to have helped
Later, brother AAGH I DON'T HAVE PERMISSION TO WRITE ;_;
if it is mounted, just sudo chmod 777 /media/<whatever automount puts here>
What will that do?
give all users write permission to that folder
Okay. Um, not sure what you mean by "whatever automount puts here" I am ridiculous, disregard what I just asked Also trying Nothing changed. Still do not have permission. You still there dude?
had to step away
It's cool You owe me nothing
try "sudo chmod 777 /media/<folder> -R
Trying Still read-only I opened nautilus with root permissions to try to change the same thing, and when I would select 'read and write files' it would reset to 'none' before I could even click 'apply permissions'
assuming the partition is /dev/sdb1, try "sudo grep sdb1 /etc/mtab"
Trying
you are looking for either ro or rw in the string that it returns
